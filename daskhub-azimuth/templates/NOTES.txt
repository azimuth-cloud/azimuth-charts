DaskHub provides a multi-user [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment
with integrated support for [Dask](https://www.dask.org/), a library for scaling
Python code on a cluster, using [Dask Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/).

## Using Dask Gateway

Dask Gateway is configured to integrate with the JupyterHub environment, so creating
a Dask cluster requires very little configuration.

For example, the following creates a Dask cluster that scales between 0 and 10 workers
on the underlying Kubernetes cluster depending on the workload:

```
from dask_gateway import Gateway

gateway = Gateway()
cluster = gateway.new_cluster()
cluster.adapt(minimum=0, maximum=10)
cluster
```

If your Kubernetes cluster has autoscaling of nodes configured, this may cause the
cluster itself to grow in size to accomodate your Dask cluster. Once you have finished
with the Dask cluster, the Kubernetes nodes will scale back down again when possible.
