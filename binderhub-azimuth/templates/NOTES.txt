BinderHub provides a multi-user [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment 
with customisable notebook images available online, ideal for classrooms and research labs.

Each user gets their own notebook server and storage allocation, where they can
work independently of each other.

If BinderHub is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling of nodes, then
a new node may be created on demand to fulfil a user request for a notebook server,
if there is not sufficient space on the cluster. When idle notebook servers are culled,
the Kubernetes cluster can then scale back down.
