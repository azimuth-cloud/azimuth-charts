BinderHub provides a multi-user [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment 
with customisable notebook images available online, ideal for classrooms and research labs.

Each user gets their own notebook server and storage allocation, where they can
work independently of each other. The storage allocation is mounted at `~/data/`
inside the JupyterHub environment so any data which requires persistence should
be stored there.

If BinderHub is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling of nodes, then
a new node may be created on demand to fulfil a user request for a notebook server,
if there is not sufficient space on the cluster. When notebook servers are deleted
by users, the Kubernetes cluster can then scale back down.
