This script should be fed the `FILE_PATH` output of the following kubectl command which
lists all container images currently in use on the target kubernetes cluster:

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}" \ 
| tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq > FILE_PATH

The script will then generate an output file named {FILE_PATH}.yml which 
is formatted such that it can be fed into the sync-images.yml github workflow to copy any 
required images into a dedicated container registry.

NOTE: In order to capture the images used by the deployed platforms (e.g. the jupyter 
notebook container) the relevant platform components should be deployed cluster before 
running this script.
